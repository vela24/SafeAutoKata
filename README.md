Step 1: Download Visual Studios and create a .NET Web APP. I included angularJS because i did not see a specified version of angular to use and I have experience using angularJS. Please keep in mind this is my first use of .NET and Visual Studio so there was a bit of struggle and time constraint. 
Step 2: Create a file input connected to the HomeControler with a Get and a Post this ends up being in a landing page of Home/Upload.
Step 3: Create a Javascript file with angularJS that takes in a file input as well as separate inputs that contain name, date, time, distance travelled, and speed. I would set up code that would disregard any inputs containing speeds less than 5 mph or more than 100 mph.
Step 4 for be to sort them in descending order for the distance traveled as well as rounding these numbers.

I apologize for not being able to complete this in time, much of my time was spend researching how to set up and use .NET MVC framework with a limited amount of time to work.
